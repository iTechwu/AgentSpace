/**
 * Map an DofeAgent Digital Employee onto an OpenAgent persona-card. OpenAgent
 * (spec at github.com/5dive-ai/openagent) is an identity/persona layer: it
 * describes who an agent IS (name, role, face, voice, behavior) and can carry a
 * self-verifying ed25519 provenance block. DofeAgent already models the "who"
 * as an ActiveEmployee, so the two compose.
 *
 * This module is the PURE, runtime-agnostic half: the persona TYPES and the
 * `employeeToPersona()` mapper. It has no Node dependency (no node:crypto, no
 * Buffer) so it type-checks under the domain package's runtime-agnostic build.
 * Signing (ed25519 provenance + did:key derivation) lives in a Node layer that
 * composes on top of this mapper — see apps/cli's openagent-persona-sign.
 *
 * PRIVACY: by default the mapper REDACTS the employee's operator instructions,
 * resolved skills, and owner identity — a persona-card is a shareable identity
 * artifact, not an export of the operator's private configuration. Callers pass
 * `includeSensitive: true` to opt those fields back in.
